Installation
============

This module is not available via pip, so you'll need to clone the repo to a local 
directory. You then need to install the required dependencies. This can be done as 
follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Once installed, please refer to the Examples.ipynb notebook for usage examples. Please 
note that it is recommended that you work in the root directory of the repo, (i.e. 
where the Examples.ipynb notebook is located), as that will ensure that the correct
filepaths are used.
